# Self-learning yaw misalignment control intelligent entity interface based on DRC_Fortran wind turbine baseline
Self-learning yaw misalignment control intelligent entity is a Kalman filter and deep reinforcement learning based yaw control model for horizontal axis wind turbine. Using [Delft Research Controller (DRC) baseline wind turbine controller](https://github.com/TUDelft-DataDrivenControl/DRC_Fortran)[1], the DISCON to interface with the remote self-learning yaw misalignment control intelligent entity has been being developed. So with DNV GL BLADED, OpenFAST and etc, you can simulate or test the self-learning yaw misalignment control intelligent entity.

# Status
DISCON interface and remote self-learning yaw misalignment control intelligent entity have been being developed.
